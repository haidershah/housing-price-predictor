# Dublin Housing Price Predictor

Predicts housing prices for Dublin, CA

## Deployment

$ python house_price_predictor.py

## Data

I first retrieved addresses of houses in Dublin, CA from OpenAddresses. Then I made Zillow Api calls to gather the missing info: sqft, bed, bath etc.

## Preprocessing

Here are the steps I took to preprocess my data:

### Data Cleaning

For houses that don't have information available on Zillow's Api, I didn't add them to the training set. For example if there's a house with missing sqft or bed etc. I ignore it.

### One Hot Encoding

Home Type is a Categorical Feature in the dataset that comprises of values: Condominium, MultiFamily, SingleFamily, and Townhouse. I've used One Hot Encoding to create 4 new features: is_condominium, is_multi_family, is_single_family, and is_townhouse.

### Outlier Removal

I made a scatter to visualize the dataset. It turned out that I had a few outliers. When running the model with those outliers, I had a negative value for my Accuracy. After removing 20% of outliers from the dataset though, I had a marked improvement in my Accuracy.

### Feature Scaling

Number of bedrooms typically range from 1-5, while lot size are in the thousands so Feature Scaling was an obvious choice.

## Features

I'm using the following features for my model:

1. sqft - Square footage of constructed area
2. lot - Square footage of land
3. bed - Number of total bedrooms
4. bath - Number of total bathrooms
5. year_built - Year the house was built
6. sold_months_ago - Number of months from today when the house was last sold
7. is_single_family - Whether the house is of type: SingleFamily
8. is_condominium - Whether the house is of type Condominium
9. is_townhouse - Whether the house is of type Townhouse
10. is_multi_family - Whether the house is of type Multi Family

## Label

last_sold_price - Last time the house was sold

## Features by importance

3. year_built
